The Virtual Mouse module allows the user to control their device's cursor using hand gestures. The module is designed to mimic the functionality of a physical mouse, with left-click, right-click, and scroll capabilities.

Keyboard
The Keyboard module allows the user to input text using hand gestures. The module recognizes various hand gestures to simulate key presses, enabling users to type without a physical keyboard.

Volume Control
The Volume Control module enables users to adjust the volume of their device using hand gestures. The module can increase or decrease volume based on the user's hand gestures.

Brightness Control
The Brightness Control module allows users to adjust the brightness of their device using hand gestures. The module can increase or decrease brightness based on the user's hand gestures.
